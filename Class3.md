 # Class 3; Conditional Probability

Def: Probability of an event triggering not based on independent probability but with a condition attached to the probability.

Ex: If flipped a coin, it will have 50% H and 50% T. But if you flipped the coin 10 times and all 10 times turn out to be H, then the next flip will have that previous condition considered into the flip.

**Ex Personal Question**: Given the user seeing list of games their friends play, what is the probability they will also buy and play those games. 

**Normal Distribution**: (Also can known as Bell Curve) 
    - Standard Deviation (Sigma) : Something different from the mean of the data set. 
    - Population Mean ('Mew') vs Sample Mean ('X bar')
    - Z Score: Meansure difference from the mean in proportion to standard deviation. ((x - (xbar))/sigma)
